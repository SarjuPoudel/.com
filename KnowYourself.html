            <p>Before understanding where you should go for higher education, 
                it is very imperative to understanding yourself and your
                priorities in your life. You are a unique individual who
                have a unique set of experiences and circumtances that 
                brought you to this phase of the life. So how do you know
                yourself? To know yourself, you may try by questioning 
                and answering some self reflective questions.

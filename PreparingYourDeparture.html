            <h2>Preparing Your Departure</h2>
            <p>
                Yahoo! You are all set. Your hard work and sleepless nights finally 
                paid off and you are now ready to embark on your long sought dream of
                attending the US College. While there is no way to fully prepare departing
                from your home and family for next four year, there are few things that
                help your transition to your new home.
            </p>
            <p>
                If it is your first time leaving your home, you should prepare for lots of
                surprises, funs, and uncertainities. First research about the area of college. 
                Revisit your living plans while attending the college. Reach out to other 
                international students or students from your country and may be pair yourself 
                with a compatible roommate. Pack cloths for the season and take some extra 
                cash for emergency purpose.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is also important to plan through which port of entry will you get into 
                United States. Did you make airport pickup arrangement with college or someone else?
                If you are travelling early, where will you stay and how do you plan to spend? Carry a 
                smartphone with you for emergency to contact your friends and family. Connect with Nepali Network group on social
                media. 
            </p>
            <p>
                On the day of Departure, check if you carried your passport, visa, I20, original academic 
                documents, attested copies of academic document, proof of insurance, and No Objection Letter from 
                Nepal Government. First time traveller may be interivewed in the transit as well as at the port of entry.
                Just answer their questions politely and you will be on your way.

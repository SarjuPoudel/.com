            <h2>Assessing Your Finances: Payment Method</h2>
            <p>
                During the application process, you will need to make payments to several agencies in the US.
                Registration for test scores, college application fee, test score submission fee, credential
                evaluation fees, and fee for other services you receive from the US must be paid in the US dollars. 
                To make payment in the US dollars, you may not have a lot of alternative as International
                payment system is not well developed in Nepal.
  </p>
            <h3>Available Payment Methods</h3>

            <ol>
                <li>Payment through bank's wire payment: This payment method 
                    is available in most of banks in Nepal but it may not be accepted by
                    some agencies in US.
                </li>
                <li>Some banks like Nabil Bank at Teendhara have payment through virtual credit card
                    which are accepted in almost all the agencies you want to make payment to.
                </li>
                <li>Other banks may have developed similar payment method, so consult the nearest bank
                    if they can make online payment on your behalf. </li>
                <li>In latest improvement to international payment system, Nepal Rastriya Bank had purpose
                    to have limited international payment credit card available to individuals as well. 
                    Check you bank if they provide such servies.
                </li>
                <li>If you know anyone in US, ask them if they can help you with payment with prior agreed conditions.</li>
                
            </ol>
            <p>Banks in Nepal charge NRs 500 or more for each transaction. You may be able to save your bank charges if you find 
                someone in the US to make payments on your behalf at lower rates than bank.

            <h2>Academic Credential Evaluation</h2>
            <p>
                Academic Credential Evaluation is a process to standarize your academic performance with that of US highschool.
                Though many colleges in US have started to understand Nepal's academic system and evaluation, some may still
                want you to have it evaluated by third party services. There are several credential evaluation agencies, 
                but WES evaluation is widely accepted in US. 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <h4>Some Credential Evaluation Agency</h4>
                <li><a href="https://www.wes.org/">World Education Services (WES)</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://ierf.org/">International Education Research Foundation (IERF)</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.naces.org/">National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES)</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.ece.org/">Educational Credential Evaluators</a></li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>As credential evaluation services are costly for initial evaluation as well as reporting it to each colleges, make sure
                you need one by asking your college. Weigh in your admission and funding possibility before committing to 
                do credential evaluation. It is recommended to use WES credential evaluation because of its acceptance in
                most of the US colleges.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <h4>Step for WES Evaluation</h4>
                <li>Sign up for a WES account.</li>
                <li>Select your academic agency or education board</li>
                <li>Pay for WES evaluation services and you will receive a cover page with paid slip.</li>
                <li>Have your academic transcripts, marksheets, and provisional certificate attested by
                    issuing agency or board.
                </li>
                <li>The attested documents along with cover page from WES must be place and sealed in
                    an envelope by your education board.
                </li>
                <li>It takes few months to complete your evaluation process.</li>
                <li>Order your evaluated documents to be mailed to your college</li>
            </ul>

            <p>WES charge you for sending your evaluated documented to each college. To minimize this,
                order a evaluation report to yourself and ask if your college may accept PDF copy of the 
                evaluation.

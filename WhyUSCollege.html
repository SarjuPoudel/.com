            <h2>Why US College?</h2>
            <p>Education system in US makes US College unique than colleges in South
                Asian countries like Nepal. 
            </p>
            <h4>Nepal Education System</h4>
            <p>Nepal's Education system has focused on gaining theoretical knowledge. Such
            education system equips students with knowledge of science behind a process
            but fails to provide develop skills that makes students ready for the job or 
            career immediately following the graduation. </p>
            <h4>US Education System</h4>
            <p>US Education provides skills that can be use in the modern workforce 
                market. The practical based education system encourage you to think
                critically and problem solve the complex problem faced by society and 
                the world. The flexibility in switching across the majors or having 
                a multidisciplinary degree makes US education distinct than education in
                south asian countries like Nepal. In addition, the US education enriches
                interpersonal, social, and political knowledge of an individual in world's
                perspective.
            </p> 
            <p>
                While the foundational differences in these education systems exist,both of the education
                systems have been good in developing human resources for local and global 
                job markets. Therefore, it is  important to look into what form of education 
                you would like to receive.

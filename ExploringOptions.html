                <h2>Tools/External Links for Exploring Your College Options</h2>
            <p>Over the course of 7 years, I have researched several resources to find the best way for exploring the college options.
                The most effective and informative resources about a college has be its own website. However, other resources have proven
                to be easier to initial screening of approaimately 4000 US Colleges.</p>

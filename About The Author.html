            <h2>About The Author</h2>
            <p>I, Sarju Poudel, am the author of contents found on this website. I graduated
                high school in 2015 from New Capital Higher Secondary School and explored
                several educational opportunities. I finally settled down with US education
                and graudated with Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering from the
                University of Texas at Tyler in May 2022. The information on this website has been compiled 
                based on my personal experience and experiences that I gathered from adivising
                other students who reached out to me over the course of 6 years. I had good 
                success with providing relevant information to graduating high school students 
                and landing them in one of their choosen US college with Full Tuition+
                scholarships. Receiving positive feedbacks and success from other students,
                I have decided to make college application information available publicly. I congratulate you
                on embarking in this new journey of higher education pursuit and wish you a good 
                luck for your future.

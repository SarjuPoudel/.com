            <h2>Assessing Your Finances</h2>
            <p>
                Financial assesstment refers to the calculation of your ability to pay
                for your college education. Your present financial circumtances may affect
                the ability to apply or attend a college in US. US colleges are expensive 
                and your cost of attendance (COA) of college may vary from $0 to $75000 per
                year. Financial assesstment is suggested to be made based on your or sponsor's 
                currently available monetary resources. Admission to some colleges depends on 
                how much money you or your sponsor put into your education.

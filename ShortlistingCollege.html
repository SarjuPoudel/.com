               make your time and effort worthwhile during the application process.

               give each college a point based evaluation which indicates the best fitness of 
               the colleges to your current and future needs. The process of shortlisting 
               is heavily based on individual perspective and circumatances. However, 
               giving a numeric value based on your preference makes it easier to decide 
               how much time should your invest for each college applications.  
            </p>
            <p>Generally, you should consider major, cost, scholarship, application fee,
                essay questions, acceptance rate, SAT/TOEFL requirements, extracurricular
                activities, and career opportunities while shortlisting your colleges. It
                is suggested to make a college list that includes colleges in all of 
                following categories based on their acceptance rate.
            </p>
            <ul>

                    chances of getting "you" admitted is undeniable. Safety college may not
                    not necessarily meet all your needs but fulfills your top priority i.e. 
                    Affordability. Depending on the academic history and SAT scores of students, 
                    the safety college list may differ for each students. These colleges do not
                    take a lot of your time and effort to complete the application.</p>
                </li>

                    expectations of college choice. The chances of getting you or a student with

                    no possibility of your admission, you should still apply to top notch college because these 
                    colleges looks overall aspect of your life rather than just academic performance. Your unique
